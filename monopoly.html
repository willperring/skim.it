	<h1>Class Structure Example: Monopoly</h1>

	<p><em>Note: I find that the easiest way to start to build up a picture of how a set of classes should operate is to start writing
	the interfaces. These have been included in the <strong>monopoly/</strong> folder for the sake of completeness. Whilst they are 
	PHP files, they are merely representitive of the interfaces these classes would have.</em></p>
	
	<h2>Main Classes</h2>
	<p>If we're following proper OOP standards, then we should have a class to represent every type of element within the game. So, 
	the very first class we would need is just that - <strong>Game</strong>. This class needs to track the number of players, and the
	spaces on the board. So from there, we can define two more classes - <strong>Player</strong> and <strong>Property</strong>. 
	<em>(aside: Not all squares on the board are properties, e.g. 'Go' and 'Just parking', etc but these are the exceptions - I feel for
	clarity these are better referred to as properties. We could define <strong>BoardPosition</strong> as well as (or as a parent class
	of <strong>Property</strong> but I feel this is arguably too complex for the scope of this question)</em>.</p>

	<p>The <strong>Player</strong> class is reponsible for holding information pertaining to the player - position on the board, funds,
	properties owned, whether the player is in jail, etc. The <strong>Property</strong> class holds information about the square on 
	the board - whether it is purchasable, which group it belongs to. This would also need to hold information about the rent of the 
	square should it be occupied by a player other than the owner once purchased. A pseudo-class for this has not been implemented, 
	but some kind of <strong>RentMatrix</strong> class, denoting the cost at various stages of development would be appropriate.</p>

	<p>We could also include a <strong>Die</strong> class, although as this is merely a random number generator, this functionality
	could be built into the <strong>Game</strong> class as a <strong>rollDie()</strong> function.

	<p>Through these classes we now have the potential to start a game, add players, and move round the board purchasing properties</p>

	<h3>Potential tricky aspects:</h3>

	<p>Some of the squares on the board do not pay rent in conventional fashion. For example, the Water Company and Electric Company
	require a roll of the die, whereas the stations depend on how many of the four are owned by the player.</p>

	<p>Whether conventional properties can be developed depends on if the player owns the complete set. With this in mind, a 
	<strong>PropertyGroup</strong> class may be appropriate.</p>

	<p>A mechanism for allowing the players to get out of jail needs to be implemented - this normallly involves three attempts at
	rolling a die (on consecutive turns) before paying a fee to get out</p>

	<p>The game needs to check at each round which players are bankrupt and end when one (or less) remain - infinite loops are fun 
	for no-one</p>

	<h2>Secondary Classes</h2>

	<p>As well as the cycle of moving around the board collecting properties, we need to implement <strong>CommunityChest</strong>
	and <strong>Chance</strong> classes to represent the card stacks on the board. These share functionality in all but the 
	individual cards, so are both derived from an abstract <strong>CardStack</strong> class. This would contain actions such as
	<strong>shuffle()</strong> and maintain arrays of the cards within them. This, in turn, gives need for a <strong>Card</strong>
	class <em>(no psuedo class for this exists, see 'tricky aspects' below)</em>

	<h3>Potential Tricky Aspects:</h3>

	<p>The <strong>CommunityChest</strong> and <strong>Chance</strong> <strong>Card</strong> classes have a wide range of effects
	on the game and the player. Care would need to be taken when building the class to allow it to cover all the neccesary actions
	as defined within the game. Examples include simple actions, like simply paying an amount of money to the bank or the other 
	players, or missing a number of turns, through to more complex actions such as paying a premium for repairs on every house or 
	hotel owned by the player.</p>
